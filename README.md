# A Quiz Webpage

Welcom to this repo, **Quiz Leen** is a simple project that I developed to improve my front-end programming skills.

### Installation

First clone repository, then open home page with your favorite browser or run it using live sever and enjoy :)

### Sections

- **Home:** The first page. Give user some information.
- **Topics:** Have a few categories to choose from.
- **Exam:** After select a topic you will be directed to this page.
- **Articles:** It's empty for now and may change to another thing.

## Questions

There is already a local quiz which is so simple and was made in initial version of project.

### Quiz with API Call

The questions arrive from [Quiz API](https://quizapi.io/) which is a simple HTTP REST API for technical quizzes including a wide variety of topics, different difficulty levels, tags and also the limit number of questions; The arrival data in GET request can be filtered by each one of these parameters.

### Future Updates

The new features that I look for:

- Tags
- Limit number
- Bookmark questions

Thank you for supporting :)
